# A useless message bot for you and me

# Steps to setup this useless message bot:
1. Fill out credentials.txt with token, bot name, and full username with tags (in this order, each one on its line)
2. Fill out messages/idle_messages.txt with messages you want, each message separated by a blank line. 
3. Run executable.

# NOTE: More work is needed in this section.
How to use more message lists (more technical):
1. Change directory to main.exe working directory.
2. Run "main.exe [the name of the message file without its parent directory]"
